# Purpose and Philosophy of Aural Skills

*“A perfect musician should be able to picture a piece, at first hearing...as though the score were visible.”*

*“You must get to the point that you can hear music from the page.”*

These two thought-provoking quotes from Robert Schumann's *Advice For Young Musicians* sum up the purpose of this class.

Aural skills are essential to professional-level musicianship. The two interdependent topics in this class are ear training and sight singing. 

## Ear Training

Ear training cultivates the ability to accurately write down music that you hear. In this class, we will cover dictation in the following subjects:

- Intervals
- Scales
- Chords
- Rhythm
- Melody
- Harmony

## Sight Singing

Sight singing cultivates score-reading ability that enables you to hear music "in your mind's ear," and perform it using moveable-do solfege and conducting.
