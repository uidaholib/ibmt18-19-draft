# Preparation for Unit 2 Sight Singing

This week's sight singing will focus on singing intervals using moveable-*do* solfege, chanting rhythms in simple meters, and putting the two concepts together in stepwise melodies in major keys. 

## Warm-Up: Find *Do* Exercise

Please print the warm-up and bring it to your audit. **If you do not bring a print-out of the warm-up to your audit, you will lose 50% of the grade for your audit.**

## Rogers/Ottman Exercises

You will be asked to perform the examples **in bold** first. Your professor will then select additional examples from those in plain type for you to perform.

1.30-1.46, **1.47,** 1.48-1.58, **1.59,** 1.60-1.62, 2.32-2.38, **2.39,** 2.40-2.45, **2.46,** 2.47-2.48 


## How to Prepare the Material

Chapter 1

Be sure to read the introductory material at the beginning of chapter, especially the section on Conductor's Beats on page 2. The point of this chapter is that any note value, not just a quarter note, can be a beat. When the bottom value of a time signature is 2, conduct a half-note beat. (Therefore, conduct 1.55 in 3, not in 6.)

Chant the rhythms, using the syllable "tah."

Duets: Please prepare both parts. Practice them with a partner so that you are not surprised by the sound of both parts together when you perform them together with the professor in your audit.

Chapter 2

The material in this chapter builds upon that in Chapter 1. It may help to practice each exercise first as a rhythmic study, and then add the pitches. 

In your audit, prepare to *solfege and conduct simultaneously.* A steady tempo is a priority -- hesitation will lose points. Prepare both parts of each duet. Practice playing the opposite part on the piano and/or practice with a partner. 

*Reminder: do not write solfege syllables in your book.* 

## Strategies for Preparation

- In melodic examples, look everywhere for "signposts." Examine your key signature, then look for all the places *do*, *mi*, and *sol* appear in the score. Look for the contexts in which we have been studying intervals this week.
- Reminder: **Do not write solfege syllables in your book. If your professor discovers that there are solfege syllables written in your book, this will incur the grade of 0 for your audit even if you did not write the solfege yourself.
- When singing duets, think both vertically (harmonically) and horizontally (melodically). A useful exercise is to practice an harmonic interval extracted from a duet. For instance, in 2.44, play the second pitch (D) on the piano and practice singing a major 6th above. Also be aware of how the parts interact. For instance, in 2.48, the upper part imitates the lower.
