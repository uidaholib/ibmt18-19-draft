# Preparation for Unit 3 Sight Singing

This week's sight singing will continue to focus on singing intervals using moveable-*do* solfege, chanting rhythms in simple meters, and putting the two concepts together in stepwise melodies in major keys. 

## Warm-Up: Find *Do* Exercise

Please print the warm-up and bring it to your audit. **If you do not bring a print-out of the warm-up to your audit, you will lose 50% of the grade for your audit.**

## Rogers/Ottman Exercises

You will be asked to perform the examples **in bold** first. Your professor will then select additional examples from those in plain type for you to perform.

**3.19,** 3.20-21, **3.22,** 3.39, **3.50,** 3.51-53, 3.66

## Guidelines for Rogers/Ottman

Again, be sure to read the introductory material in each chapter of Rogers/Ottman, as that will inform you about the nature of the material. Are you consistently following the phrasing as marked?

Remember: prepare **both** parts of each duet. Tip: make sure to practice duets with a partner. A successful performer knows what the piece sounds like as a harmonic whole.
