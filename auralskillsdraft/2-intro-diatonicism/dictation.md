# Q. What Is Diatonicism?

The materials we will learn about in Aural Skills III - intervals, scales, chords, rhythm, melody, and harmony - will come from Western **diatonic** melody and harmony. 

When we talk about "diatonicism," we mean melody and harmony that are composed from elements of the diatonic (“white key”) scale and its modes. Most Western classical and popular musics are diatonic, and work under related principles.

## Intervals

The intervals we study in this class will encompass all the simple intervals, i.e. all the intervals contained within the octave. **All simple intervals can be found between pitches of the diatonic scale without the need for adding chromaticism.**

## Scales

 This class deals with the diatonic scale and its modes. We will study major, natural minor, melodic minor (different ascending and descending), harmonic minor, plus Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian modes.

## Chords 

In this class, we will study four types of triads (three-note chords):
- major - *do mi sol*
- minor - *la do mi* OR *do me sol*
- diminished - *ti re fa*
- augmented - *sol ti ri*

In addition to triads, we will also study five types of seventh chords (four notes): 
- fully diminished - *ti re fa le*
- half diminished (also known as diminished minor) - *ti re fa la* OR *re fa le do*
- minor minor - *la do mi sol* OR *re fa la do*
- major minor - *sol ti re fa*
- major major - *do mi sol ti* 

All of these chords have very specific uses in diatonic harmony, which we will study in detail.

## Rhythm and Meter

We will study simple time signatures such as 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, and 2/2, and compound time signatures such as 3/8, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8. We will study rhythmic procedures such as divisions and subdivisions of the beat.

## Melody

Diatonic melodic phrases, especially those from the Classical era, typically fall into two types: (1) the sentence, and (2) the period. Diatonic melodies are often derived largely from chords I, IV, and V.

Diatonic melodies use predictable cadence patterns (i.e. there may be an implied perfect cadence at the end).

Diatonic melodies are often repeat “ideas,” sometimes exactly and sometimes with different tones.

## Harmony

The most common chords in diatonic harmonic progressions are: the tonic triad (I),the dominant triad (V), the dominant seventh chord (V7), and the subdominant triad (IV).

## Overview

One of the main themes in this class will be the fact that melody and harmony move in very predictable ways. If you learn these patterns, identifying elements in isolation becomes much easier and more predictable.
