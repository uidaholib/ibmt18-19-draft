# Triads - Review of the Principles

- The **major triad** is composed of a stacked major third plus minor third. The two commonest ways it appears in diatonic harmony are as chord I in a major key (*do-mi-sol*), and chord V (*sol-ti-re*) in major AND minor keys. It's also very common for it to appear as chord IV in major keys (*fa-la-do*).

- The **minor triad** is composed of a stacked minor third plus major third. It also occurs within the diatonic scale. In minor keys, it appears most commonly as chord i (*do-me-sol*). In major keys, it appears commonly as chord ii (*re-fa-la*)and as chord vi (*la-do-mi*).

The **diminished triad** is composed of two stacked minor thirds. It functions as chord vii0 in both major and minor keys, as well as chord ii0 in minor keys. In this class, we will *always* spell this chord *ti-re-fa* when we are singing it outside of a melodic or harmonic context. **Please don’t attempt to spell or sing the diminished triad *do-me-se.* Not all chords relate to *do*, and this spelling has no context in diatonic music.**

The **augmented triad** is composed of two stacked major thirds. It is relatively rare in diatonic harmony. It doesn’t naturally occur within the tones of the diatonic scale, and sounds very chromatic. For this reason, many learners find it hard to sing. When it does occur, it is usually spelled *sol-ti-ri* and appears as a chromatic variant of the dominant (*sol-ti-re*).

## Identifying Triads in Inversions

### Step 1: 
- Listen to the “color” of the triad. Often you will be able to tell the chord quality from only one hearing. Major and minor tend to be unmistakable. Be careful to distinguish between augmented and diminished triads, the two dissonant ones. If unsure, listen contextually, using your solfege and diatonic harmonic logic.

### Step 2: 
- Listen to the triad intervallically. An inverted triad will have some kind of fourth in it. In major and minor, there will be a perfect fourth. In a diminished triad, there will be an augmented fourth. In an augmented triad, the symmetricality of the chord means that all intervals will sound as major thirds, regardless of the inversion and notation. For this reason, you may identify all augmented triads as 5/3 in tests.
